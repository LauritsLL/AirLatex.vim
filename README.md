**Note** This Work is currently in Progress. Please use it right now only for testing purposes.  
**Notes regarding Vim 8 support**: Vim 8 will be supported in the future, however i could not make it work completely, yet. If you need this feature feel free to contribute. (See `vim8` branch for current state.) ;)

Install
=======
1. Install the requirements. (python3)
    ```
    pip3 install browser_cookie3 tornado requests pynvim
    ```
2. Install the Vim Plugin itself
    Using **Vim Plug**:
    ```
	Plug 'da-h/AirLatex.vim', {'do': ':UpdateRemotePlugins'}

    " optional: set server name
    let g:AirLatexDomain="www.overleaf.com"
    ```
    
    Using **Vundle**:
    ```
	Plugin 'da-h/AirLatex.vim'

    " optional: set server name
    let g:AirLatexDomain="www.overleaf.com"
    ```
    After installation using `:PluginInstall` run `:UpdateRemotePlugins` to register the python plugin.
3. For the login, this plugin uses [`browser_cookie3](https://github.com/borisbabic/browser_cookie3). **Please use Firefox or Chrome to login.** Browser_cookie3 will find the right cookie for the server. :)
4. Open AirLatex in Vim with `:AirLatex`

Feel free to map AirLatex to a binding of your liking, e.g.:
```
nmap <leader>a :AirLatex<CR>
```

This plugin is a complete rework of [Vim-ShareLaTeX-Plugin](https://www.github.com/thomashn/Vim-ShareLaTeX-Plugin).  
I took all the good ideas and added even more vim love ‚ù•. ;)
