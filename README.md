# AirLatex.vim

This is a fork of [da-h/AirLatex.vim](//github.com/da-h/AirLatex.vim) providing comments, track changes, and some code organization for a vim Websocket Client for Overleaf.
As is, this is customized to my workflow- with no added hooks for broader customization. If you'd like to add some, please create a PR- as this is a won't fix for me.

**Current State**: Use at your own risk.
> **Warning**
> **What's the worst that can happen?** Something breaks and automatically clears the buffer. You can easily recover this with the version history in overleaf, but it's still a pain, and might mess up your comment positions. This has only happened to me once when actively developing this plugin, but it's worth noting here.

I have been using this to write my thesis, so it isn't all bad.

## First Use

This plugin is a bit paternalistic in its approach, since debugging multiple
login methods is not sustainable. See the [original AirLatex](//github.com/da-h/AirLatex.vim) for a login
workflow.

### Authenticating
You should not have to reauthenticate once you have authenticated and leave the
session. Both of these methods are relatively persistent.

#### Go H$%^k yourself
To get started, login into your OverLeaf/ShareLatex instance in Firefox.
Firefox does not locally encrypt cookies, and AirLatex will [Cookie
Jack](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Session_hijacking_attack) the
session cookie to connect to the server. It's a little like hacking yourself,
and a nice reminder that any program you run on your machine can do this
and more. Here's [the relevant code](https://github.com/dmadisetti/AirLatex.vim/blob/7549f019fb097f10a1cf5a0ab50b22d7e5d20003/plugin/airlatex.vim#L67-L78) if you are interested.

Once you are logged in, set `g:AirLatexCookieDB` to the path to the cookie database.
If you are lazy, just try:
```
let g:AirLatexCookieDB="~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/cookies.sqlite"
```

For a custom or enterprise solution, you'll have to play with additional settings:
 - g:AirLatexCookieKey
 - g:AirLatexDomain

**You will need sqlite for this**

#### Set the cookie yourself
Log into to your instance, and take a look at your cookies.
You can explicitly set the Cookie with
```
let g:AirLatexCookie="cookies:overleaf2_session=justanexamplestring;maybe_morecookies=1"
```

For details on how to check your cookies [look at this issue](https://github.com/da-h/AirLatex.vim/issues/38).

### Installing
#### With Nix
```
nix run github:dmadisetti/airlatex.vim#
```
Or add to your flake or what not. If you use nix, you know the drill.

### Normal Installation
1. Install the requirements. (python3)
    ```
    pip3 install tornado requests pynvim intervaltree beautifulsoup4
    ```
2. Install the Vim Plugin itself
    Using **Vim Plug**:
    ```
    Plug 'dmadisetti/AirLatex.vim', {'do': ':UpdateRemotePlugins'}
    " Auth and settings mentioned in the documentation.
    ```

    Using **Vundle**:
    ```
    Plugin 'dmadisetti/AirLatex.vim'
    " Auth and settings mentioned in the documentation.
    ```
    After installation using `:PluginInstall` run `:UpdateRemotePlugins` to register the python plugin.

### Launching
Open AirLatex in Vim with `:AirLatex`
Feel free to map AirLatex to a binding of your liking, e.g.:
   ```
   nmap <leader>a :AirLatex<CR>
   ```

## Settings

Variable | Possible Values | Description
-------- | --------------- | -----------
`g:AirLatexDomain` | `www.overleaf.com` (default) | Base url of the overleaf instance you would like to connect to.
`g:AirLatexShowArchived` | `0` (default, off), `1` (on) | Show/hide archived projects in the project list.
`g:AirLatexUseHTTPS` | `1` (default, on), `0` (off) | Choose between http/https.
`g:AirLatexLogLevel` | `NOTSET` (default), `DEBUG_GUI`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL` | Verbosity of logging.
`g:AirLatexLogFile` | `AirLatex.log` (default)  | Log file name. (The file appears in the folder where vim has been started, but only if the log level is greater than `NOTSET`.)
`g:AirLatexWebsocketTimeout` | `10` (default)  | Number of seconds to wait before declaring the connection as *stale*. This may happen if the server does not answer a request by AirLatex. Setting to `"none"` disables this feature. However, it can be the case that you will not notice when something is wrong with the connection.
`g:AirLatexAllowInsecure` | `0` (default, off), `1` (on) | Allow insecure connection. For example, if the server is self hosted and/or the certificate is self-signed
`g:AirLatexTrackChanges` | `0` (default, off), `1` (on) | Allow track changes to be sent.

## Bindings

The following bindings are scoped to the buffers. If you'd like to customize
them, please create a PR.

Buffer | Binding | Description
-------- | --------------- | -----------
sidebar | `q` | Close buffer
sidebar | `enter` | Enter project/ Toggle folder
sidebar | `d`, `D` | Leave project
document | visual `gc` | Mark section for drafting a comment
document | visual `gt` | Resolve track changes under visual area
document | `R` | Refresh document, or bring back online if connection dropped.
document | command `:w` | If project is synced with github, create a new commit.
comments | `<C-n>` | Next comment (for stacked comments)
comments | `<C-p>` | Prev comment (for stacked comments)
comments | `ZZ` | Submit comment in draft
comments | `ZQ` | Quit Buffer/ discard draft
comments | (insert) | Start drafting a response if on thread
comments | `enter` | Un/resolve project if over the relevant option.

## Want to use Vimtex or otherwise emulate local compile artifacts and source?

### Local source

I got you fam. With overleaf premium, the turn on the dropbox option, and set `g:AirLatexUseDropbox=1`
Don't have overleaf premium? Complain to your institution, many universities will buy a subscription.

In theory, your files should now be located in `/run/user/<uid>/airlatex/mount`.

#### Additional setup
Note, running airlatex as a flake should do this instantly, but otherwise:

Install `rclone`, and make sure you can mount dropbox folders.

Run `AirLatex_DropboxSync` to get everything lined back up. Dropbox sync is not instantaneous, so be careful with this methodology- but useful for adding figures etc..

### Local file artifacts (pdf, aux, etc)

Some programs like vimtex expect file to be local so they can parse build artifacts behind the scenes.
toos/`airmount`creates a Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE folder), that will make it seem like all your artifacts are local.

In theory, your build artifacts should now be "located" in `/run/user/<uid>/airlatex/builds/<project id>`

#### Additional Setup
Note, running airlatex as a flake should do this instantly, but otherwise, here's the invocation nix uses:

```bash
BASE=/run/user/$(id -u)/airlatex
mkdir -p $BASE/builds

VIMTEX_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY=$BASE/active \
PATH=$PATH:$${airmount}/bin:${airlatexmk}/bin nvim \
    --listen $BASE/socket \
    -c AirLatex
```

Please create a PR if you find a reliable way of spawning airlatex with this, I just use the nix flake.
The key things are:
 1. `airmount` is in your PATH (this is the condition for mount attempt)
 2. python deps: `fuse` and `requests`

#### With Vimtex or something else
Note, this will only work with Dropbox activation.

Add `airlatexmk` to your path if you are using vimtex or something that would normally use `latexmk`.
This program "pretends" to compile, but just nicely asks Overleaf to actually compile behind the scenes, it will ignore complex arguments, and may break if `airlatex` or the relevant project is not open.

The relevant vimtex options are automatically set in `plugins/airlatex.vim`.

### Recommended Bindings

Additional bindings that are nice to have, but not required for functionality.

```vim
" AirLatex Keybinds
if exists("g:AirLatexIsActive") && g:AirLatexIsActive
  nnoremap <space>n :call AirLatex_NextCommentPosition()<CR>
  nnoremap <space>p :call AirLatex_PrevCommentPosition()<CR>
  nnoremap <F2> :call AirLatexToggleTracking()<CR>
  nnoremap <C-x> :call AirLatexToggle()<CR>
  nnoremap X :call AirLatexToggleComments()<CR>
endif
```

## Troubleshooting

**If you find a bug.**
Feel free to open an issue!
To make things a bit easier for me, please use AirLatex' debug mode (`let g:AirLatexLogLevel='DEBUG'`).


## Credits

This plugin is a complete rework of [Vim-ShareLaTeX-Plugin](https://www.github.com/thomashn/Vim-ShareLaTeX-Plugin).
I took all the good ideas and added even more vim love. ‚ù• ;)
